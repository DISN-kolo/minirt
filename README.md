# Leaks

On Linux, MLX suddenly started producing leaks that weren't caught before with the mac's "leaks" program (confirmed with FDF which was fine on our macs but having switched to Linux started showing the **same** amounts of leaks!)

More info can be found on https://stackoverflow.com/a/3857638 ... TL;DR: "still reachable" isn't of concern.
